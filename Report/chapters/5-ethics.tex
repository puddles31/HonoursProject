The original project objectives involved surveying users about their experience with the web application, so the Artefact Evaluation form was filled out and submitted. However, as this objective was moved down to a lower priority, the user survey was ultimately not conducted. The Artefact Evaluation form can be found in \textbf{\hyperref[appendix:artefact]{Appendix A}}.
