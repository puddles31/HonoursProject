% Talk about making moves on the cube/kilominx, and briefly talk about the idea of skipping moves to reduce search
% For kilominx, talk about fixing a cubie in one position, and how this affects the moves

\section{Populating Pattern Databases}
% Talk about the design of the pattern databases themselves, and how they are populated via search
% How did I choose which cubies for the pattern databases?

% Talk about using Lehmer codes to calculate database indices - full maths section here

\section{Searching for Solutions}
% Talk about IDA* search

\section{Interacting with the Puzzles}
