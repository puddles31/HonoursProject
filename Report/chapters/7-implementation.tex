% How the implementation was done and tested, with
% particular focus on important / novel algorithms and/or data
% structures, unusual implementation decisions, novel user
% interface features, etc.

% Use of Enums and Consts?

% Talk about things done for efficiency
% - Using bytes instead of ints
% - Direct array manipulation

% How did I implement the Lehemer code computation?
% How did I make it efficient?

% Pattern database classes - N and K? Size? Rank calculations?
% For kilominx, draw attention to how the fixed cubie is NOT counted

% PDB population - BFS vs IDDFS?

% Solver - IDA*? How to use the PDBs as a heuristic?

% UI - displaying puzzle state? editing?
% GUI?

% Testing?
