\section{Korf's Algorithm for the Rubik's Cube}
% Go into detail about Korf's paper for the rubik's cube. Mention any important design decisions he made. Relate it to what I am doing.
\subsection{Iterative-Deepening A*}
\subsection{Pattern Databases}
% Small section here about the other pattern databases paper. Why use pattern databases?

\subsection{Sequential Indexing with Lehmer Codes}
% Again, more here to do with sequential indexing and lehmer codes. Use Korf's other paper, and possibly the article that explains it.

\section{God's Number}
% What research has been done on God's Number for the cube and the kilominx? What methods were used? How does it relate to what I'm doing?

\section{The Kilominx}
% Any research on the Kilominx?
